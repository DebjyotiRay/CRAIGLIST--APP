My first app
Lets crack it buddies
This is an web developed app can be run on any system if the computer has python installed on the machine and added to the path variable of the computer 
this is actualy a clone of the craigslist.org of LosAngeles, i could have done it for Kolkata as well but many required items are not found in the kolkata craigslist.org, So i opted for the LosAngeles one.
STEPS FOR RUNNING THIS ON YOUR PC:
PREREQUISITES: PYTHON,
A suitable text editor, either SublimeText or Pycharm or VSCode will do
You may also install pip on your pc, just browse to the get-pip.py on your pc from cmd, either Windows Powershell or Anacaonda Prompt,
and just run the command python get-pip.py

DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE GITHUB REPOSITORY
CLONE THIS ON YUR PC
OPEN MY_CODE FOLDER
IN CMD, HIT python manage.py runserver
That gives a site link, the localhost site
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Go to this link, an dif all goes well u should see my app.
